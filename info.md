## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why no IE8 support?

Microsoft has end-of-lifed it, and very very few people are using it these days.

### What about ES6?

Footwork is based on and will continue to be based on and follow KnockoutJS and its API. At present the public release of KnockoutJS is ES5-based, and so Footwork is too.

In the near future, Footwork will have its separate modules separated and converted to ES6 for use with [Knockout TKO](https://github.com/knockout/tko) - the future of Knockout still in development that is updated for ES6+.

### Who made Footwork?

Footwork is a project created and maintained by [Jonathan Newman](https://github.com/jonbnewman).
