<p>Footwork is an expressive, component-based, fully-featured frontend javascript framework based on <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>. It is built around the <a href="http://docs.footworkjs.com/release/latest/architecture/">MVVM software architecture pattern</a> and aims to be highly extensible and configurable while at the same time providing sane conventions and a consistent easy to use API.</p>

<h3>I can hear you already, <em>another framework??!</em></h3>

<p>There are a lot of other front-end frameworks out there, why use this one? Footwork provides a forward-looking approach to single-page-app development utilizing the excellent two-way binding, component, and other features of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>. It provides an approach to application development that keeps a firm grounding in proven methodologies while providing features and architecture that help make app development fun.</p>

<h3>Why not just use Knockout, or Knockout + X?</h3>

<p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> is a great library, but its focus on UI binding, components, and observables leaves it lacking a lot when it comes to building a full single-page app. Footwork fills in those gaps and provides novel features that makes application creation fun and expressive while eliminating a lot of common boilerplate many other frameworks require.</p>

<p>...and while you <em>can piece together something</em> from various independent libraries, what you end up with will likely not be as cohesive, well tested, documented, or iterated on as Footwork is.</p>

<h3>I prefer a different framework, why would I consider Footwork?</h3>

<p>Then stick with it, if it works.</p>

<p>But if you are open to something new, Footwork provides a uniquely clean and expressive API which is different from its competitors. Focusing on the ever changing javascript landscape, providing a powerful and expressive API, and remaining idiomatic and compatible with Knockout and its various libraries is the goal of this project.</p>

<p>It's basically another take on javascript development, it may or may not be your cup of tea.</p>
