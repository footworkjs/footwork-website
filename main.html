  <h1>Why Footwork?</h1>

  <p>There are a lot of front-end frameworks out there, why use Footwork? In short, it fills a niche for fans of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> that want to use it to write fully single-page applications. It has other reasons to be used, such as its more novel features (ex: <a href="http://docs.footworkjs.com/release/latest/broadcastable-receivable/">broadcastable / receivable</a>) as well as its very expressive and easy to manage development methodology based on context and nesting.</p>

  <p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> is a great library, but it lacks a lot when it comes to building a full single-page app. Footwork fills in those gaps and provides novel features that makes application creation fun and expressive.</p>

  <p>If you want a forward-thinking but not a 'lets redo everything about everything' no-nonsense framework built around getting your application completed without a lot of fuss - then Footwork is worth checking out.</p>
