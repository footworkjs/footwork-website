  <h2>Why Footwork?</h2>

  <p>The aim is to enable the creation of fully featured single-page Knockout-based applications that are expressive, capable, and maintainable. Footwork provides the missing SPA-holes that knockout-only applications typically have, as well as providing some additional novel features not found in other frameworks.</p>

  <p>Aimed at users or fans of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>, if you are in that category you should definitely take a look.</p>
