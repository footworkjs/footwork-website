  <h1>Why Footwork?</h1>

  <p>I hear you already, <em>another framework??!</em></p>

  <p>There are a lot of front-end frameworks out there, so why use Footwork? In short, it fills a niche for fans of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> that want to use it to write single-page applications. Footwork provides a fully featured, consistent, and expressive API with a forward look at frontend application development that keeps a firm grounding in known methodologies and techniques.</p>

  <p><em>Why not just use Knockout, or Knockout + X?</em></p>

  <p><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> is a great library, but its focus on UI binding, components, and observables leaves it lacking a lot when it comes to building a full single-page app. Footwork fills in those gaps and provides novel features that makes application creation fun and expressive while eliminating a lot of common boilerplate many other frameworks require.</p>

  <p>...and while you can piece together something from various independent libraries, what you end up will likely not be as cohesive, well tested, documented, or iterated on as Footwork is.</p>

  <p><em>I prefer X framework, why would I consider Footwork?</em></p>

  <p>Then stick with it, if it works.</p>

  <p>But if you are open to something new, Footwork provides a uniquely clean and expressive API which is different from its competitors. Focusing on the ever changing javascript landscape, providing a powerful and expressive API, and remaining idiomatic and compatible with Knockout and its various libraries is the goal of this project.</p>

  <p>It's basically another take on javascript development, it may or may not be your cup of tea.</p>
