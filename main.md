<em class="intro">Footwork is a frontend framework based on [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) that aims to be fully featured, expressive, and easy to use while remaining as idiomatic and compatible with Knockout and its code base as possible.</em>

<div class="intro-paragraph">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <ul>
      <li>Custom elements/components and declarative view models</li>
      <li>Automatic resolution and binding of declarative resources</li>
      <li>Page routing with unlimited outlet support</li>
      <li>Transition effect and animation system including sequenced animations</li>
      <li>Does not require a build system or module loader (but it works great with them)</li>
      <li>Inter-module communication and state sharing</li>
      <li><em>Much, much more...</em></li>
    </ul>

# Why Would I Use It?

Knockout applications have typically not been as fully featured or as capable as applications based on other, more featureful libraries/frameworks. Footwork aims to fill that void providing a comporably complete framework with unique architectural advantages.

Aimed at users or fans of [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/), if you are in that category you should definitely take a look.
