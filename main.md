# What is it?

Footwork is a frontend javascript framework based on [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) that aims to be fully featured, expressive, and easy to use while remaining as idiomatic and compatible with Knockout and its existing code base as possible.

It has features such as:

* Custom elements/components and declarative view models
* Automatic resolution and binding of declarative resources
* Page routing with unlimited outlet support
* Transition effect and animation system including sequenced animations
* Does not require a build system or module loader (but it works great with them)
* Inter-module communication and state sharing
* Much, much more...

# Why Would I Use It?

Knockout applications have typically not been as fully featured or as capable as applications based on other, more featureful libraries/frameworks. Footwork aims to fill that void providing a comporably complete framework with unique architectural advantages.

Aimed at users or fans of [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/), if you are in that category you should definitely take a look.
